A Date with Databases. This meet up would be all about Databases- the internals and the overall. The idea is to tear down databases, across relational/non relational, and understand them deep down.

Talk Scheduled (so far) - 

• Database-Days of the future past ( Avinash Nijampure)

• SQLite - Why aren't you using it more? (Srimathi Harinarayanan & Navaneeth KN)

• Databases as event streams (Shashank Teotia)

• A bunch of lighting talks. 





P.S. - We are open for talks - session/lighting. 

Lunch would be served in the office.
