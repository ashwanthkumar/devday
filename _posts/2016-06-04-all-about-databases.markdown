A Date with Databases. This meet up would be all about Databases - the internals and the overall.
The idea is to tear down databases, across relational/non relational, and understand them deep down.

Talks&#58;

* Database-Days of the future past ( Avinash Nijampure)
* SQLite - Why aren't you using it more? (Srimathi Harinarayanan &amp; Navaneeth KN)
* Databases as event streams (Shashank Teotia)
* A bunch of lighting talks.
